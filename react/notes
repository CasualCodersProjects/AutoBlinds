ChakraUI
MaterialUI
AntDesign

These are the big three component libs.
can find smaller ones online and use them.
start with MaterialUI
download elements. premade things (components)
such as buttons or sliders or calenders.



I think a nice, clean/simple UI could really just be a page that's horizontally or vertically (I perfer three vertical bars for 19:9)
then thorw a switch at the top of each segment to enable or disable a given stepper motor. Possibly deisng the page to look like the PCB?
can maybe show status or potentiometer position at the top. Perhaps a semicricle or arc thing? Color code each one as well? RGB or some
part of the CC Colors. Dark mode by default ofc.

then below that is the main thing. I need to create a table of sorts for open and close times for each day.
Nevermind. We're going horizontal.

I could maybe try to do the table thing like seen in when2meet, but that'd be... 48 boxes tall and 7 wide. That's excessive.
